# Hey there! I'm Dane. üëã ü§ì

I'm an experienced IT pro and aspiring machine learning engineer based in Kansas. With over a decade in tech support and consulting, I've recently pivoted toward AI, Python development, and cybersecurity.

I love great food, hiking, video games, and exploring the cutting edge of tech.
